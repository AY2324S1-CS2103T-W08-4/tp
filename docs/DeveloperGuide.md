### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deletep 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletep 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PharmHubParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePersonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PharmHubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `PharmHubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the PharmHub data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PharmHub`, which `Person` references. This allows `PharmHub` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/PharmHubStorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both PharmHub data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PharmHubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
    * The Main Application has 3 JsonAdapted component in storage: `JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedOrder`, `JsonAdaptedMedicine`.
      * `JsonAdaptedPerson` further contains `JsonAdaptedTag` and `JsonAdaptedAllergy`.
      * `JsonAdaptedOrder` further contains `JsonAdaptedStatus` and `JsonAdaptedMedicine`.`

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.pharmHub.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Edit person feature

After adding a person in PharmHub, the user would be able to edit the person using the `editp` command with the following format:

`editp INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] [no/ALLERGY]â€¦â€‹ [ia/]`

The command edits the person information based on the given fields. At least one field must be updated.
Existing values will be replaced with the new input values.
If the edits cause the person to be allergic to any orders associated with them, a warning will be raised. Using the `ia/` flag will override this warning.
This command cannot add or delete orders for this person. It's limited to editing the person's information only.

Prerequisite: There should be a person at index 1, with "Aspirin" in the PharmHub medicine list and also among one or more of his/her orders.

The following sequence diagram illustrates some of the steps that happen when user execute `editp 1 no/Aspirin`
![editp](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)


Step 1: The user executes `editp 1 no/Aspirin` to add the allergy "Aspirin" to the person at index 1.

Step 2: Logic Manager calls `PharmHubParser#parse` which extracts the arguments and calls `EditPersonCommandParser`. 

Step 3: `EditPersonCommandParser` parses the index and the allergy and returns an `EditPersonCommand`.

Step 4: `LogicManager` calls `EditPersonCommand#execute` to edit the details of the person.

Step 5:  Since an allergy is added in this command, and an `ia/` flag is not passed as an argument, `EditPersonCommand` checks among the list of order of the person whether there are any medications that match this allergy by calling the `hasOrderConflict()` function.

Step 6: Since there are medications that match this allergy, a `CommandException` is returned.

Step 7: An error message is shown to warn the user that the person's new allergy conflicts with existing orders, and hints the user about adding the `ia/` flag to add the allergy to the person anyway.


`EditPersonCommand#execute` utilizes the following method `Person#hasOrderConflicts` to check if there are any conflicts between the person's allergy and his/her orders.
```java
    public boolean hasOrderConflicts() {
        return orders.stream().anyMatch(o -> isAllergicToAny(o.getMedicines()));
    }

}
```

`Person#isAllergicToAny(medicines)` returns true if the person is allergic to any of the given medicines.

```java
    public boolean isAllergicToAny(Set<Medicine> medicines) {
        return medicines.stream().anyMatch(medicine -> isAllergicTo(medicine));
    }
```

### Adding an Order feature

#### Implementation

The adding an Order feature allows the user to add an order to a person.
<br>
1. The add order feature includes the ignore allergy flag to allow further flexibility for the pharmacist when assigning orders
   to people. This is because they may have other considerations when it comes to assigning a medication for a person.
2. The add order feature do not allow duplicated order as we believe that each order should be distinct base on
   their order number, ensuring that no orders go missing or forgotten.

#### Steps to Trigger

1. The User launches the application.
2. The User executes "addo 1 m/aspirin o/1" to add a new order.
3. The `AddOrderParser#parse()` checks whether all the prefixes and the required values are provided.
4. If the check is successful, the `ParseUtil#parseOrderNumber`, `ParseUtil#parseOrderNumber` and `ParseUtil#parseMedicine` 
will then check and create an `Index`, `OrderNumber` and `Medicine` passing it to `AddOrderCommand`.
5. Depending on whether an ignore allergy flag `ia/` is added in the command input, user can input medications in the order that the person is allergic to. 
6. `AddOrderCommand#execute` then checks if the person exist base on index and creates an Order with the
`person`, `orderNumber`, `medicine` and a `PENDING` Status, then `Model#hasOrder` also checks whether the order is a duplicated order.
7. If the order does not exist, then the `Model#addOrder` adds the order into the order list.

#### Design Consideration

The following sequence diagram shows how `addo` works on an example input. `addo 1 m/aspirin o/1000`

![AddOrderSequenceDiagram](images/AddoSequenceDiagram.png)

### Finding an Order Feature

#### Implementation

The finding an Order feature allows the user to find other base on either the orderStatus, medication in the order or both.
<br>
1. The find order feature allows independent Predicate finding.
    1. i.e. you can find order base on only `Status` or `Medicine`.
    2. We implemented this format to expend the utility of the feature.

#### Steps to Trigger

1. The User Launches the application. 
2. The User decides to find/filter through the order list after adding multiple orders.
3. The User executes "findo s/pd m/pan ibuprofen" to find orders that has `PENDING` status and either `PANADOL` or `IBUPROFEN` in the order.
4. The `FindOrderCommandParser#parse()` checks whether all the prefixes and the required values are provided.
5. If the check is successful, depending on the User input if `s/` is present `ParseUtil#parseStatus` will return a
`Status`, and if `m/` is present `ParseUtil#parseMedicines` will return the `Medicine/s`.
6. The `Status` and `Medicine` will then be passed to the FindOrderCommand.
7. The `Model#updateFilteredOrder` will then take either or both `Status` and `Medicine` as predicates to filter through the order list and return valid orders.
8. The filtered order list will then be returned and shown on the Displayed list.

#### Design Consideration

The following sequence diagram shows how `findo` works on an example input. `findo s/pd m/pan ibuprofen`

![FindOrderSequenceDiagram](images/FindoSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPharmHub`. It extends `PharmHub` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `pharmHubStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPharmHub#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current pharmHub state in its history.
* `VersionedPharmHub#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous pharmHub state from its history.
* `VersionedPharmHub#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone pharmHub state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPharmHub()`, `Model#undoPharmHub()` and `Model#redoPharmHub()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPharmHub` will be initialized with the initial pharmHub state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single pharmHub state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in PharmHub. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitPharmHub()`, causing the modified state of PharmHub after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `pharmHubStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted pharmHub state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitPharmHub()`, causing another modified pharmHub state to be saved into the `pharmHubStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPharmHub()`, so PharmHub state will not be saved into the `pharmHubStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPharmHub()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous pharmHub state, and restores PharmHub to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial PharmHub state, then there are no previous PharmHub states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPharmHub()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoPharmHub()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores PharmHub to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `pharmHubStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest pharmHub state, then there are no undone PharmHub states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPharmHub()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify PharmHub, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitPharmHub()`, `Model#undoPharmHub()` or `Model#redoPharmHub()`. Thus, the `pharmHubStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPharmHub()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `pharmHubStateList`, all pharmHub states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire pharmHub.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Listing all orders

The listing all orders functionality is supported by the listPanelPlaceholder in the Ui.

On start of application, two listPanels (PersonListPanel, OrderListPanel) is created, and person list panel is attached
to the ListPanel Placeholder as default.

On execution of the any listing commands (`listo` or `listp`), the resultant CommandResult contains details on which
panel to choose to display.

These are 3 different options for these details:
* Person - Panel will display list of people
* Order - Panel will display list of orders
* NoChange - Panel will keep whatever was there previously

Using these specifications, the CommandResult from executing `listo` and `listp` will inform the Ui of which
panel to attach to the listPanelPlaceHolder
