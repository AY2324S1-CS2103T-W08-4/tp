### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletep 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PharmHubParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PharmHubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PharmHubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /> <br />
<img src="images/ModelObjectsDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the PharmHub data i.e., all `Person`, `Order`, and `Medicine` objects.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Order`, `Medicine` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/PharmHubStorageClassDiagram.png" width="900" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both PharmHub data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PharmHubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
    * The Main Application has 3 JsonAdapted component in storage: `JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedOrder`, `JsonAdaptedMedicine`.
      * `JsonAdaptedPerson` further contains `JsonAdaptedTag` and `JsonAdaptedAllergy`.
      * `JsonAdaptedOrder` further contains `JsonAdaptedStatus` and `JsonAdaptedMedicine`.`

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.pharmHub.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. 

### Add medicine short form feature  

#### Implementation
After the creation of new `Medicine`, a short form can be assigned to that `Medicine` using the `sfm` command.  
After this command, the user would be able to use this short form interchangeably with the full name in fields requiring medicine or allergy names.    
Currently, only one short form can be assigned to one `Medicine` at a time.  

#### Steps to trigger
Step 1: The User launches the application.
Step 2: The user executes `sfm 1 m/pan` to add the short form of `pan` to the medicine at index 1 in the last shown medicine list.  
Step 3: Logic Manager calls `AddressBookParser#parse` which extracts the arguments and calls `ShortFormCommandParser`  
Step 4: `ShortFormCommandParser` parses the index, short form name and returns a `ShortFormComamnd`   
Step 5: `LogicManager` calls `ShortFormCommand#execute` to assign the short form to the medicine.   
Step 6: `ShortFormCommand` checks if an existing medicine with the same name or same short form is already present using `Model#hasMedicine(m)`.   
Step 7: The `Medicine` at index 1 is replaced with a new `Medicine` which has same medicine name but with `pan` as the short form.   

The following sequence diagram illustrates some of the steps that happen when user execute `sfm 1 m/pan`

![AddShortFormSequenceDiagram](images/AddShortFormSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifelines should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>  
 
`Model#hasMedicine(m)` utilizes the following method `Medicine#isSameMedicine` to check equality of two `Medicine`.  
```java
public boolean isSameMedicine(Medicine m) {
        if (m == this) {
            return true;
        }
        if (m == null) {
            return false;
        }
        return (medicineName.equalsIgnoreCase(m.medicineName)
                || medicineName.equalsIgnoreCase(m.shortForm)
                || m.medicineName.equalsIgnoreCase(shortForm));
}
```

### Delete medicine short form feature  
#### Implementation
`sfm` can also be used to delete the short form of a medicine by providing the `d/` flag.
If the `d/` flag is provided any provided medicine names using `m/` will be ignored.   
Hence `sfm 1 m/pan d/` will
be treated as deleting the short form of medicine at index 1 in the last shown medicine list. 

#### Steps to trigger
Given below is an example scenario to delete the short form of medicine at index 1. 

Step 1. The user lists all medicines using the `listm` command.  
Step 2. The user deletes the medicine at 1st index using `sfm 1 m/pan d/`  
Step 3: Logic Manager calls `AddressBookParser#parse` which extracts the arguments and calls `ShortFormCommandParser`  
Step 4: `ShortFormCommandParser` parses the index, ignores the short form and returns a `ShortFormComamnd`   
Step 5: `LogicManager` calls `ShortFormCommand#execute` to delete the short form of medicine at index 1.   
Step 6: The `Medicine` at index 1 is replaced with a new `Medicine` which has same medicine name but with no short form.


The following activity diagram summarises the sequence of steps for the whole `sfm` command.

<img src="images/ShortFormActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />


### Adding an Order feature

#### Implementation

The adding an Order feature allows the user to add an order to a person.
<br>
1. The add order feature includes the ignore allergy flag to allow further flexibility for the pharmacist when assigning orders
   to people. This is because they may have other considerations when it comes to assigning a medication for a person.
2. The add order feature do not allow duplicated order as we believe that each order should be distinct base on
   their order number, ensuring that no orders go missing or forgotten.

#### Steps to Trigger

1. The User launches the application.
2. The User executes "addo 1 m/aspirin o/1" to add a new order.
3. The `AddOrderParser#parse()` checks whether all the prefixes and the required values are provided.
4. If the check is successful, the `ParseUtil#parseOrderNumber`, `ParseUtil#parseOrderNumber` and `ParseUtil#parseMedicine` 
will then check and create an `Index`, `OrderNumber` and `Medicine` passing it to `AddOrderCommand`.
5. Depending on whether an ignore allergy flag `ia/` is added in the command input, user can input medications in the order that the person is allergic to. 
6. `AddOrderCommand#execute` then checks if the person exist base on index and creates an Order with the
`person`, `orderNumber`, `medicine` and a `PENDING` Status, then `Model#hasOrder` also checks whether the order is a duplicated order.
7. If the order does not exist, then the `Model#addOrder` adds the order into the order list.

The following sequence diagram shows how `addo` works on an example input. `addo 1 m/aspirin o/1000`

<img src="images/AddoSequenceDiagram.png" width="1400" />


### Finding an Order Feature

#### Implementation

The finding an Order feature allows the user to find other base on either the orderStatus, medication in the order or both.
<br>
1. The find order feature allows independent Predicate finding.
    1. i.e. you can find order base on only `Status` or `Medicine`.
    2. We implemented this format to expend the utility of the feature.

#### Steps to Trigger

1. The User Launches the application. 
2. The User decides to find/filter through the order list after adding multiple orders.
3. The User executes "findo s/pd m/pan ibuprofen" to find orders that has `PENDING` status and either `PANADOL` or `IBUPROFEN` in the order.
4. The `FindOrderCommandParser#parse()` checks whether all the prefixes and the required values are provided.
5. If the check is successful, depending on the User input if `s/` is present `ParseUtil#parseStatus` will return a
`Status`, and if `m/` is present `ParseUtil#parseMedicines` will return the `Medicine/s`.
6. The `Status` and `Medicine` will then be passed to the FindOrderCommand.
7. The `Model#updateFilteredOrder` will then take either or both `Status` and `Medicine` as predicates to filter through the order list and return valid orders.
8. The filtered order list will then be returned and shown on the Displayed list.

The following sequence diagram shows how `findo` works on an example input. `findo s/pd m/pan ibuprofen`

<img src="images/FindoSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200" />


### ViewX feature

The `viewp/ viewo` feature allows users to view details of a person/ order in the info display panel. This is facilitated with the new interface, `InfoObject`, which classes that want to be displayed are required to implement.

To support this feature, `CommandResult` has the field `InfoObject`. If present (not null), the UI will create and attach a view for that `InfoObject` onto the Info Display.

The code excerpt for `MainWindow#handleDisplayInfo(InfoObject)` below shows how the InfoDisplay is rendered:

```java
    @FXML
    protected void handleDisplayInfo(InfoObject objectToDisplay) {
        assert(objectToDisplay instanceof Order || objectToDisplay instanceof Person);

        if (objectToDisplay instanceof Order) {
            Order order = (Order) objectToDisplay;
            OrderDisplay orderDisplay = new OrderDisplay(order);
            infoDisplay.attach(orderDisplay)
        } else if (objectToDisplay instanceof Person) {
            Person person = (Person) objectToDisplay;
            PersonDisplay personDisplay = new PersonDisplay(person);
            infoDisplay.attach(personDisplay)
        } else {
            throw new RuntimeException("Invalid object to display");
        }
    }
```


The following sequence diagram shows how the `viewp` operation works:

![ViewpSequenceDiagram](images/ViewpSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/ViewActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** As it currently stands in PharmHub, InfoObject can only be a Person or an Order.

</div>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How the UI is informed about the object to display:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Require Classes that want to be displayed to implement `InfoObject`
    * Pros: Allows `CommandResult` to contain a uniform type (`InfoObject`), which scales easily. Also gives control over which classes can be displayed, and which classes cannot (yet). 
    * Cons: Empty `InfoObject` interface may lead to confusion for new developers.

* **Alternative 2:** Have `CommandResult` contain all types of objects that we want displayed, ie `Person` and `Order`
    * Pros: Possibly clearer in intent
    * Cons: Not easily scalable

**Aspect: Creation of relevant `InfoObject` UI component:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** If-else checks in `MainWindow#handleDisplayInfo`, and create the required UI component for each clause
    * Pros: Reduces coupling between `Person` (and `Order`) model and UI
    * Cons: Less scalable

* **Alternative 2:** Create abstract method `InfoObject#createUIComponent`, and have Classes that wish to be displayed implement this method and create their own UI components
    * Pros: Easily scalable - each class implements their own UI display to attach into the placeholder
    * Cons: Increased coupling between UI and Model. UI-creation code exists inside the `Person` (or `Order`) Class

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPharmHub`. It extends `PharmHub` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `undoHistory Deque` and `redoHistory Deque`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPharmHub#canUndo()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if there is a previous PharmHub state to revert to
* `VersionedPharmHub#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous PharmHub state from its `undoHistory.
* `VersionedPharmHub#canRedo()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if there is a future PharmHub state to revert to.
* `VersionedPharmHub#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone PharmHub state from its `redoHistory`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#canUndo()`, `Model#undo()`, `Model#canRedo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPharmHub` will be initialized with the initial pharmHub state, and the `CurrentState` points to that single pharmHub state. Both `undoHistory` and `redoHistory` will be empty. 

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deletep 5` command to delete the 5th person in PharmHub. The `deletep` command calls `Model#deletePerson`, which in turn calls `VersionedPharmHub#deletePerson`. This causes the `VersionedPharmHub` to save the current state into `undoHistory`, before calling `PharmHub#deletePerson`, which deletes the person from PharmHub

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addp n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `addp` command calls `Model#addPerson`, which in turn calls `VersionedPharmHub#addPerson` repeating the process in step 2.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which does the following things in order. It saves the current state into `redoHistory`, updates `Current State` to the last state in `undoHistory`, and removes that last state from `undoHistory`.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Before the undo operation, the `Model` will first check if an undo is possible in the first place, and it does so by calling `VersionedPharmHub#canUndo()`, which checks if `undoHistory` is empty. If an undo operation cannot be done, an error is thrown by the `Model`.</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which saves the `Current State` into `undoHistory`, sets the `Current State` as the last state in `redoHistory`, and removes said state from `redoHistory`. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Similar to `undo`, if `Model#canRedo` returns `False`, ie. the `redoHistory` is empty, then the `Model` throws an error.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify data in PharmHub, such as `list`, will not change the `undoHistory` or `redoHistory`

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#Clear()`, which in turn calls `VersionedAddressBook#Clear()`. As before, the `Current State` is added to `undoHistory`, and then `PharmHub#clear()` is called, which changes the state. Moreover, the `redoHistory` will be cleared, preventing users from running `redo` after a data-modifying non-undo command. Reason: This is how most applications handle undo/redo.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire pharmHub.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletep`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Aspect: Effects (Scale) of undo & redo:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only affects data-modifying operations
    * Pros: Simple to implement, provides essential functionality
    * Cons: Non-data-modifying commands cannot be undone, eg. `list`

* **Alternative 2:** Affects all commands
    * Pros: Changes in view can be undone, leading to greater convenience. Easily extensible to undo certain views
    * Cons: Versioning has to be extended to keep track of UI, which may lead to increased coupling.

### ListX

The listing functionality is supported by the listPanelPlaceholder in the Ui.

On start of application, two listPanels (PersonListPanel, OrderListPanel) are created, and person list panel is attached
to the ListPanel Placeholder as default.

On execution of the any listing commands (`listo` or `listp`), the resultant CommandResult contains details on which
panel to choose to display.

These are 3 different options for these details:
* Person - Panel will display list of people
* Order - Panel will display list of orders
* NoChange - Panel will keep whatever was there previously

Using these specifications, the CommandResult from executing `listo` and `listp` will inform the Ui of which
panel to attach to the listPanelPlaceHolder

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Currently, to delete a short form a medicine the user has to provide `d/` flag through the `sfm` command to delete the short form
   of a medicine at a specified index. However, if any short form name is provided using the `m/` flag, it will be ignored without any
   warning. Thus, `sfm 1 m/met d/` deletes the short form the medicine at index 1 which ignoring `met`. We plan to make the `sfm` 
   command accept exactly one of `m/` or `d/` flags. This way the command `sfm 1 m/met d/` would be regarded as an invalid command 
   rather than one which deletes the short form. 

1. Currently, when adding a medicine there is no way for the user to specify the short form right then. Hence, the user has to first add
   the medicine followed by using `sfm` command to add a short form to it. We plan to allow `addm` accept an optional parameter for 
   the short form of the medicine being added. 

1. Currently, Undo and Redo commands do not affect the UI. As such, commands such as `listp` and `findp` cannot be undone. Moreover, this makes it such that a recently added person, that is later deleted by `undo`, will still be visible in the Info Display, until another command (eg. `viewp`) displaces it.<br />
Example:<br />
Originally, PharmHub has the following display.<br />
<img src="images/BetterUndo-0.png" width="574" /> <br />
After adding a 'newguy2' using `addp`, he shows up in the Info Display.<br />
<img src="images/BetterUndo-1.png" width="574" /><br />
On `undo`, the person's information still stays on the Info Display, even though he no longer exists in PharmHub.<br />
<img src="images/BetterUndo-2.png" width="574" /><br />
We plan to enhance the Undo/Redo feature to allow UI changes to be undone/ redone. In this way, UI states are saved along with the data, and can be reverted with `undo` and `redo`.<br />
In the case of the example given, after the implementation of this planned enhancement, the UI should revert back to an empty display after the `undo` command is ran.


## **Appendix: Effort**
AB3 only deals with one entity type, `person`. However, our project was harder as we had to deal with three entity types, `person`, `order` and `medicine`. 
These 3 entity types, with their high degree of interconnectivity, required careful and precise control to ensure that referential integrity was upheld.

The dependencies slowed the project timeline as features often relied on each other to be complete. This affected our ability to work in parallel.
Moreover, we had to take extra precaution in checking the validity of data that is being loaded from the storage file as a `person` could be allergic to multiple `medicine` and  could hold multiple `order` which in turn could hold multiple `medicine`.
